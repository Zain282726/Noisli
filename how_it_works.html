            <p>Working from home requires a lot of self-discipline as you find yourself in an environment that you associate with your private time and which is full of distractions inviting you to procrastinate.</p>
            <p>Most of the time it is also too quiet. Every spike in noise, being it maybe your neighbors or your family members, can bring you out of focus.</p>
            <p>A lot of us turn on the TV or the radio to keep us company and to indirectly mask other noises, but these tools are not designed to do so and rather seek for our attention. Noisli is the better option to drown out sudden noises and to help you create an inspiring work environment at home. You can either stream Noisli through your speakers or use it with headphones to drown out annoying noises.</p>

            <p>Noisli is a great tool to make studying more efficient. Nobody can concentrate for a prolonged amount of time, thus you can use Noisli to help you study in smaller sessions using our Timer.</p>
            <p>Our background sounds can help you to put yourself into a relaxed study mode and to help you stay concentrated for longer periods of time. This will allow you to reduce the impact of outside distractions such as phone or social media notifications and to study in a more efficient way.</p>
            <p>Noisli is also powerful in class, as it allows students to find a calm space among all the other classmates. You can use Noisli to enhance individual concentration or to fuel creative writing by creating an inspiring atmosphere.</p>

            <p>If you’re a frequent traveller you will know that finding an environment for peace and calm that lets you focus is very challenging. Being it on your daily commute, on the bus or train, or up in the air, peace and calm is a rarity in such busy environments. You find yourself in ever-changing, buzzing places, where the noise environment around you is out of your control.</p>
            <p>Noisli can be your little helper to enter a familiar workspace in order to get things done and stay productive also on the go.</p>

            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3">Noisli to Relax</h1>
            <p>Being in nature is one of the best ways to relax, relieve stress, and refuel our batteries. If you don’t have the chance to be in nature in moments when you need it, you can use Noisli to bring nature to you. Background sounds of nature are especially stress relieving as we associate them with relaxation and calmness. But also being transported onto a cozy train ride while sipping a cup of coffee can be very relaxing.</p>
            <p>Noisli allows you to choose what works best for you and adapt it to your needs, no matter if you’re having a 10-minute break at work, or if you want to wind down after a stressful day. Of course, you can use Noisli also to create a special atmosphere in your home to enjoy your time alone or with your friends and family.</p>

            <p>Being a good sleeper is the starting point to enjoy your day and to get the most out of it. The noise of the city or your wandering mind can leave you laying in bed for several hours without being able to fall asleep.</p>
            <p>Noisli can be a great way to start a familiar nighttime routine, putting you at ease and helping you to fall asleep more easily.</p>
            <p>The masking abilities of background sounds can once again help you to mask annoying noises such as the neighbors next door or the environment outside. Don’t forget that background sounds can be very soothing also for the little ones.</p>

            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3">Why Noisli Works</h1>
            <p>Silence and loud noises are usually associated with danger, thus making us alert. It is the opposite of what we need when we want to focus or relax. Background noise, on the other hand, is a sound that doesn’t contain spikes in volume, that is very constant, and rather predictable, keeping therefore our inner alarm systems calm.</p>
            <p>Moreover, due to the high amount of different frequencies contained, background sounds have great masking abilities, reducing the negative impact of sudden spikes in external noise in our environment. While listening to such background sounds, every additional noise adds to the sounds you’re already hearing and doesn’t stand out so much anymore. Therefore, additional noises are blended in and you don’t perceive them as disturbing as you normally would. This is also why music with lyrics can bring us easily out of focus, especially when having to deal with tasks that involve writing or reading. Music tends to be more rhythmic and unpredictable, and if it contains lyrics, it will easily mess with your concentration and shift your focus to the lyrics instead of the task at hand.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the right amount of background noise, not too quiet and not too loud, can also help you to think in a more abstract way enhancing creative thinking.</p>
